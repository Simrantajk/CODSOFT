# TASK 2: [Student Grade Calculator](task2.java)

This is a simple Java program that allows you to calculate your total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade based on the marks obtained in each subject. Whether you're a student, a teacher, or just someone interested in calculating grades, this program can be a useful tool.

The program follows these steps:

You input the marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
The program calculates the total marks by summing up the marks obtained in all subjects.
It computes the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the total number of subjects.
It then assigns grades based on the average percentage achieved.
Finally, the program displays the results, showing the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

Whether you're a student looking to calculate your grades or an educator wanting to streamline the grading process, this program provides a straightforward solution. Feel free to use, modify, or contribute to this project to suit your needs!
